**UI / UX:**

* Redesigned and reimplemented the entire user interface. It looks a lot nicer!
* Replaced ability and stat initials on cards with icons. Cards now look a lot nicer, too!
* Added the ability to zoom in on a card by holding Alt while hovering over it
* Replaced hero and minion initials with emoji
* Added a button to view a hero's entire deck at once
* Added the ability to adjust the UI scale using the +/- keys
* Added a game transcript to keep track of turns and initiative. More to come with this!

* Added all of Bain

Amazingly, I've still been working on this project. I've changed the interface a lot from the previous release to make it more usable and easier to read. I'd love some testers to make sure all the heroes we currently have are working properly.
